# Purpose
This repo provides the best practice for building a React Native app. It contains various POC sample app for each feature / item that we wish to utilise in our mobile app. Also this repo focus on our current technical debt of our main super-app.

For each of the items listed below, we try to create a project/sample code to tackle that issue. 

Each project is parked under its own folder, and itself should only contain the minimal scaffolding to achieve our target. It should contain the steps to run itself, preferably Expo.

# Methodology
There are many ways to make a React Native app, but there exist a 'best common practice' style out there. It is our job to evaluate for each task we're trying to tackle against a list of criteria. When undergoing each task, developer should present multiple sample code that is universally accepted as the best practice (popularity, github stars, used by certain company), state each sample's pro and cons, and pick the best one out of it.
